# Changes Made to server.js

## 1. Added Features
**Added cleanup handler:**
```javascript
process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
    await webService.cleanup();
    process.exit(0);
});
```
- Why: Ensure proper browser cleanup on program interruption
- Effect: Better resource management and cleanup

## 2. Core Functionality Preserved
All original functionality maintained without changes:
- HTTP server creation
- Configuration loading
- Parallel processing setup
- Manual/Auto crawl logic
- Server port configuration
- Error handling in crawlBusiness

## 3. Structure Comparison
**Original Structure:**
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const config = require('./config');
const pages = config.urls;
const parallel = require('paralleljs');
const crawler = require('./crawler');
// ... server setup and business logic ...
```
- All original imports preserved
- All original function signatures maintained
- Original flow logic unchanged

## 4. No Breaking Changes
The following critical features remain identical:
- Server initialization
- Port configuration
- Crawl business logic
- Error handling
- Process management
- Config integration

## Impact Summary
The only substantive change is the addition of proper cleanup handling through the SIGINT handler. This improves resource management without affecting the core functionality of the server.

## Behavior Changes
Before:
- No explicit cleanup on program interruption
- Resources might remain allocated after stopping

After:
- Proper cleanup on CTRL+C (SIGINT)
- Better resource management
- Same core functionality


# Changes Made to rules.js

## 1. Module Name Change
**Original:**
```javascript
const Rules = {
```
**Changed to:**
```javascript
const rulesService = {
```
- Why: Consistent naming convention with other services
- Effect: No functional impact, just better code organization

## 2. checkRules Method Rewrite
**Original:**
```javascript
checkRules(hrefs) {
    const urlsToReturn = [];
    hrefs.forEach((url) => {
        const urlToPush = url;
        if (this.doNotIgnore(urlToPush)) {
            urlsToReturn.push(urlToPush);
        }
    });
    return urlsToReturn;
}
```
**Changes:**
- Replaced with more efficient filter-based implementation
- Added input validation
- Added debug logging (commented out)
- Improved performance by removing unnecessary variable assignments
- Effect: More reliable URL filtering with better error handling

## 3. URL Filtering Logic
**Original approach:** Used doNotIgnore method which called notExemptions
**New approach:** Direct filtering in checkRules with explicit conditions
- Why: Simplified logic flow, easier to maintain
- Effect: Same filtering results but more efficient processing

## 4. Core Functionality Preserved
All original features maintained:
- URL validation against strictPresence
- Hash route filtering
- Ignore strings checking
- URL sorting functionality
- Configuration integration

## 5. Performance Improvements
- Replaced array push operations with filter
- Reduced function call overhead
- Added input validation
- Added optional debugging capability

## Impact Summary
The changes maintain complete backward compatibility while improving:
- Code efficiency
- Error handling
- Debugging capability
- Performance
- Maintainability

No critical functionality was removed or altered in a way that would change the original behavior of the URL filtering system.
